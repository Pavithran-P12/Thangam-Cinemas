## 🛠️ Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Repository Structure
```
your-repo/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── Banner (1).jpeg
│   │   ├── Banner (2).jpeg
│   │   └── ... (all banner images)
│   └── movies/

│       └── Movie2/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── pages.yml
└── README.md
```

### 2. GitHub Pages Workflow
A GitHub Actions workflow has been created at `.github/workflows/pages.yml` that will:
- Automatically deploy when you push to main branch
- Handle all static file serving
- Enable GitHub Pages with proper configuration

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Create Repository**: Create a new GitHub repository
2. **Upload Files**: Push all your files to the main branch
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**: 
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will handle the rest automatically

### Option 2: Manual GitHub Pages
1. **Upload Files**: Push to main branch
2. **Enable Pages**: Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. **Select Branch**: Choose main branch, root folder

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Movie Poster Loading
- **Current Setup**: Uses fetch() API to load movie posters dynamically
- **GitHub Pages Behavior**: May have CORS restrictions
- **Built-in Solution**: Fallback mechanism shows default content if movies don't load
- **Result**: Website works perfectly even if movie files aren't accessible

### Content Security Policy
